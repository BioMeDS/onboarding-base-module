# Protocol Guidelines

If you complete this module as part of an official practical in the BioMeDS group at the University of WÃ¼rzburg (typically a master f1 practical in Biosciences or similar), you need to write a protocol as part of your examination.

Here, we provide some guidelines to write your protocol, because bioinformatics protocols in general and the protocol for this onboarding module in particular differ from standard protocols in other disciplines.

## General hints

- keep the protocol concise - there is no page limit (in neither direction)
- use the standard structure:
    - Introduction
    - Material and Methods
    - Results
    - Discussion
- some things that belong to Material & Methods in other disciplines are Results in bioinformatics (e.g. if the purpos of your work is the development of an analysis pipeline, the final pipeline is a result)
